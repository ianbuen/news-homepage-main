## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow 

### What I learned

I have learned that to make a CSS Grid Layout, it is required to define a container and set its display property to 'grid'. The sizing and areas of the Grid Layout can also be defined using 'grid-column-templates', 'grid-row-templates', and 'grid-areas'. For the child objects of the container, the area where the child would be placed can be defined by using 'grid-area' property.

I have never really used CSS Grid Layout and I found it powerful in setting up the page structure. I can see myself using this more along with Flexbox (that I'm actually used to).

### Continued development

I will definitely be tinkering more with Grid Layout, practicing various styles and sectioning.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuOXPWCh-6o) - CSS Grids in 100 seconds by Fireship. Helped me a ton in introducing me to the concept.

- (https://grid.malven.co/) - The CSS Grid Cheatsheet by Malven Co. Very useful to look for anything that you need to apply your project.
